# M3 — Core domain on-device test plan

**Companion to:** [MILESTONES.md M3](MILESTONES.md), [TDD.md §3 / §5 / §6 / §9](TDD.md)
**Goal:** Verify the M3 exit criterion — `WhisperIntentCore` records from a real mic, transcribes via WhisperKit medium, and emits a final transcript string, all driven by `TranscriptionSession` and observable through the in-app debug button. Until this checklist is green, the audio + transcription stack is **not** proven to work on real hardware.

Tick boxes inline as you go. Paste console excerpts and transcripts where the document calls for them.

## 0. Prerequisites

- [X] iPhone running iOS 26.x available (note exact version: `26.4.2`).
- [X] Mac running Xcode 26.x (note exact version: `26.5`).
- [X] Device paired to Xcode, developer mode enabled, signed in with a provisioning-capable Apple ID.
- [X] AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones available (used in §4 route-loss test). Optional; mark §4 N/A if unavailable.
- [n/a] A second phone (or VoIP service) available to call this device (used in §3 interruption test). Optional; mark §3 N/A if unavailable.
- [X] Branch `develop` checked out locally with the M3 commits merged in. (`git log --oneline -5 develop` should show the AudioRecorder + debug-recording-view commits.)

---

## 1. Build & install

- [X] From the project root: `make generate` to regenerate `WhisperIntent.xcodeproj` from `project.yml` (picks up any new files added to `App/WhisperIntent/`).
- [X] Open `WhisperIntent.xcodeproj` (`xed .` or double-click).
- [X] Select the **WhisperIntent** scheme. Pick **Release** as the build configuration (Debug skews ML perf and we want representative timing).
- [X] Set the run destination to your physical iPhone.
- [X] Build & Run (⌘R). Wait for first launch on device.
- [X] Verify `RootView` appears: `Whisper Intent` title + the `Open spike harness` button.

**Observed app version / build:** `1`

## 2. First-launch permission prompt

The `DebugRecordingView` requests microphone permission lazily on the first tap of **Start recording**. Mic permission must be in the `.undetermined` state for this section (it is on a fresh install).

- [ ] Tap **Open spike harness** from `RootView`.
- [ ] Tap **Open recording harness** in the M3 section.
- [ ] Confirm the State shows `idle`, mic-permission line shows `undetermined`.
- [ ] Tap **Start recording**. iOS should show a permission alert. The heading reads `"Whisper Intent" Would Like to Access the Microphone` (supplied by iOS). The body underneath comes from `App/WhisperIntent/Info.plist` (key `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`) and should read **exactly**: "Whisper Intent records your voice when an Apple Shortcut calls the Transcribe Speech action. Audio stays on your iPhone."
- [ ] Tap **Allow**.
- [ ] Mic-permission line should update to `granted`. State should transition to `recording`. Level bar should start moving.

| | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Permission prompt appeared | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Description text matches Info.plist | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| State transitioned to `recording` after grant | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |

**If the prompt never appears or the app crashes immediately:** check the Xcode console for "This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description" — that means `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` is missing from the built `Info.plist` and the build is stale.

## 3. Golden path — short utterance

Test the basic record → transcribe → result cycle with a single short sentence.

- [ ] If state is anything other than `idle`, tap the action button to reset.
- [ ] Tap **Start recording**.
- [ ] State shows `recording`. Level bar moves while you speak.
- [ ] Speak a short, distinctive sentence (e.g., **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"**) — about 3–4 seconds.
- [ ] Tap **Stop**.
- [ ] State transitions: `recording → processing(starting) → processing(phase(encoding)) → processing(phase(decoding)) → completed`. Each transition should be visible briefly. The encoding → decoding transition can be very fast on shorter inputs.
- [ ] Transcript appears in the box below.

| Step | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Recording started cleanly | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Level meter moves with voice | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Stop transitioned to processing | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Processing reached `completed` | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Transcript is plausibly correct | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |

**Transcript actually produced:** `_________________________________________________`

**Time from Stop tap to `completed` state:** `_____` seconds (eyeball estimate is fine)

---

## 4. Long utterance — ~60 seconds

Verifies the recorder + transcriber handle a non-trivial buffer without exhausting memory or producing a degraded transcript.

- [ ] Tap the action button to reset, then tap **Start recording**.
- [ ] Speak continuously for ~60 seconds. Read a paragraph from a book, recite a memorised passage, or describe what you're looking at right now.
- [ ] Tap **Stop**.
- [ ] Wait for transcription to complete. Note wall-clock time.
- [ ] Skim the transcript for obvious quality regressions (dropped words mid-sentence, long stretches of garbled output, runaway repetition).

| | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Recording captured the full ~60s | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Transcription completed | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Transcript reads coherently | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |

**Transcription wall-clock time:** `_____` seconds

**Anything notable about the transcript:**

## 5. Phone-call interruption mid-recording

The recorder subscribes to `AVAudioSession.interruptionNotification` and should surface `failed(interrupted)` when iOS pauses the audio session — TDD §5.1.

Skip and mark N/A if you don't have a way to phone this device. Cellular call is the most reliable interrupter; FaceTime / WhatsApp also work.

- [ ] Tap the action button to reset, then tap **Start recording**.
- [ ] Speak normally for a few seconds.
- [ ] Have the second device place a call to this iPhone (or initiate a FaceTime call).
- [ ] Observe the state on the iPhone as the call rings / connects.
- [ ] State should transition to `failed(interrupted)`. The level bar should freeze. The transcript box should not appear.
- [ ] Decline / hang up the call.
- [ ] Tap **Start recording** again to verify the session can be restarted cleanly after an interruption.

| | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| State went to `failed(interrupted)` | ☐ pass ☐ fail ☐ N/A | |
| App did not crash or hang | ☐ pass ☐ fail ☐ N/A | |
| Restart after interruption works | ☐ pass ☐ fail ☐ N/A | |

## 6. Route loss — AirPods disconnect mid-recording

Tests `AVAudioSession.routeChangeNotification` handling with reason `.oldDeviceUnavailable` — TDD §5.1.

Skip and mark N/A if no Bluetooth headphones are available.

- [ ] Connect AirPods (or other Bluetooth headphones) to the iPhone.
- [ ] Confirm audio is being routed to them (Control Center → AirPlay icon).
- [ ] Tap the action button to reset, then tap **Start recording**.
- [ ] Speak normally for a few seconds.
- [ ] Disconnect the AirPods (open the case, or hold both stems until they unpair, or toggle Bluetooth off).
- [ ] Observe the state on the iPhone.
- [ ] State should transition to `failed(interrupted)`. Level bar freezes.
- [ ] Reconnect AirPods (or toggle Bluetooth back on if disabled).
- [ ] Tap **Start recording** again to verify a clean restart.

| | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| State went to `failed(interrupted)` | ☐ pass ☐ fail ☐ N/A | |
| App did not crash or hang | ☐ pass ☐ fail ☐ N/A | |
| Restart after route loss works | ☐ pass ☐ fail ☐ N/A | |

## 7. Permission denial path

Verifies `requestMicrophone()` surfaces denial cleanly.

- [ ] Open **Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone → Whisper Intent**. Toggle it **off**.
- [ ] Return to the app. (May require a relaunch — iOS sometimes terminates apps when their privacy switches change. If so, relaunch from the home screen.)
- [ ] Tap **Open spike harness → Open recording harness**.
- [ ] Tap **Start recording**.
- [ ] Mic-permission line should read `denied`. An error message should appear: "Microphone permission not granted (denied)."
- [ ] State should remain `idle`. No crash, no recording.
- [ ] Re-enable microphone access in Settings.
- [ ] Tap **Start recording** again. Should now proceed into `recording` cleanly (no second prompt — permission is already granted).

| | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Denied state surfaces error | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| App does not crash on denial | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Re-grant via Settings works without prompt | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |

---

## 8. Backgrounding mid-recording

The recording UI is a debug screen, not the AppIntent foreground sheet — so this is informational only. It tells us how `AVAudioEngine` behaves when the app is backgrounded without the proper background-audio entitlement (which v1 doesn't include).

- [ ] Tap the action button to reset, then tap **Start recording**.
- [ ] Swipe up (home gesture) to send the app to the background while still recording.
- [ ] Wait ~5 seconds.
- [ ] Swipe back to the app.
- [ ] Observe the state.

| | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| State after foregrounding | record what state was: `_______________` | |
| App did not crash | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| Restart from current state works | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |

**Acceptable outcomes:** the recording continues (iOS may allow audio capture briefly while backgrounded), OR the session transitions to `failed(interrupted)` because iOS suspended the audio session. Either is fine for the debug view. The production AppIntent will set `supportedModes: [.background, .foreground(.dynamic)]` and have a different lifecycle — that's M5/M4 territory.

## 9. Memory check — multiple consecutive recordings

Catches leaks or buffer accumulation across sessions. PRD allows long recordings; we want to confirm the recorder cleans up its accumulator on each cycle.

- [ ] Open Xcode → **Debug Navigator** (⌘7) → with the app running, watch the Memory gauge.
- [ ] Note the baseline memory before any recording: `_____` MB.
- [ ] Record + stop + wait for transcription 5 times in a row (short ~5-second utterances each, no need to read the transcript).
- [ ] Note the memory after the 5th completion: `_____` MB.
- [ ] Difference should be small (≪ 50 MB). Significant growth indicates a leak in the accumulator or observer chain.

| | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Memory stays roughly flat | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |
| No assert / fatal error across 5 cycles | ☐ pass ☐ fail | |

---

## 10. Console scan while attached

- [ ] Run the app from Xcode (so the console is attached).
- [ ] Repeat the golden-path test from §3 once.
- [ ] In the Xcode console, search for: `error`, `failed`, `deprecat`, `entitle`, `denied`, `crash`, `assertion`.
- [ ] Paste anything suspicious below.

```
(paste here — or write "no issues" if clean)
```

## 11. M3 exit criterion — final sign-off

The M3 exit criterion in MILESTONES.md:

> `WhisperIntentCore` can record a sample audio file from a real mic, transcribe it via WhisperKit medium, and emit a final transcript string — all driven by `TranscriptionSession`, with progress callbacks flowing through the state stream. Verified on a real device via a temporary in-app debug button.

Mark complete only when sections 1–3 + 7 + 10 are all passing. Sections 4–6, 8, 9 are highly recommended but not strict gates for M3 — failures there go on the M6-hardening list rather than blocking M4.

- [ ] M3 exit criterion met.
- [ ] No P0 issues observed (crashes, hangs, missing transcript on the golden path).
- [ ] Issues that surfaced and need follow-up:
  - (list any here, with milestone they belong to — M4 / M5 / M6)

Once green, close GitHub issue #7 with a one-line summary, then green-light M4 (Spike S3 — background execution budget).

## 12. Troubleshooting

**App crashes immediately on Start recording with no console message:**
- Most likely the build is stale and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` isn't in the running binary's `Info.plist`. Clean build folder (Shift+⌘+K), then rebuild.

**State goes to `failed(transcriptionFailed)` immediately when tapping Start:**
- Read the error text — it'll have the underlying message. Common causes: WhisperKit model not found in bundle, AVAudioSession setup failed (rare on iOS), AVAudioEngine couldn't start (also rare).
- Check Console.app for system-level audio errors filtered to the WhisperIntent process.

**Transcript is gibberish or empty:**
- Confirm the model directory is actually in the bundle: in Xcode, with the running app selected → Debug Navigator → tap the process → look at "Loaded Models". If `openai_whisper-medium` isn't there, the bundling broke.
- Try the same utterance through the S1 spike harness (`Run 30s sample`). If S1 works but this doesn't, the issue is in the AudioRecorder's PCM output (sample rate, channel count, format), not WhisperKit.

**Level meter never moves:**
- Confirm mic permission is granted.
- Check whether the input route is bound to a working device (Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone shows other apps are working).
- Try with internal mic only (disconnect any Bluetooth).

**Long delay between Stop and `completed`:**
- Expected on first run of the process — WhisperKit lazy-loads the medium model (~1.5 GB) on the first transcribe call. Subsequent runs reuse it.
- Spike S1 measured ~25 Hz progress callbacks with no degradation on a 5-minute sample. If you're seeing pauses that look like a stall, capture a sample with Instruments → Time Profiler.

**Recording UI looks frozen:**
- The action button disables itself while an async operation is in flight (`actionInFlight`). If it stays disabled forever, that suggests the underlying `Task` never returns — file a follow-up with the state value visible at the time.
